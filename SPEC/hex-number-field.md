# hex-number-field (depends on hex-poly-z + hex-roots + hex-resultant + hex-berlekamp-zassenhaus + hex-matrix + hex-row-reduce)

Executable algebraic numbers in `ℂ`, fixed number fields, and roots of
polynomials with algebraic coefficients. The library provides three related
representations:

- `QAdjoin p x` is the canonical coordinate representation in the fixed field
  `ℚ(x)`, with `x : SimpleRoot p` and rational coefficients reduced modulo `p`.
- `AlgebraicRoot` identifies a root of a primitive, positive-leading,
  squarefree integer polynomial. The polynomial need not be irreducible or
  minimal. This is the factorization-lazy representation used by arithmetic.
- `AlgebraicNumber` identifies a root of its canonical irreducible minimal
  polynomial. This is the exact canonical representation.

“Lazy” refers only to factorization. Every stored root has a
`RefinedIsolation`, so identity and approximation remain certified eagerly.

## Executable irreducibility

The shipped Mathlib-free API separates the semantic class
`Hex.ZPoly.Irreducible p` from the factorization-backed Boolean
`Hex.ZPoly.isIrreducible p`. This library adds the runtime-constructible wrapper

```lean
class ZPoly.CheckedIrreducible (p : ZPoly) : Prop where
  is_true : ZPoly.isIrreducible p = true
  pos_degree : 0 < p.degree?.getD 0
```

Checked constructors branch on the Boolean and can therefore return this
evidence without importing factorization correctness. The positive-degree
field is essential because the integer irreducibility checker also accepts
prime constants, whose rational quotients are not number fields. The Mathlib
companion uses `ZPoly.isIrreducible_iff` to turn `CheckedIrreducible` into the
shipped semantic `ZPoly.Irreducible` class and then into irreducibility over `ℚ`.
The computational library exposes the operations needed by its algorithms; it
does not claim a law-bearing field instance from the Boolean alone.

Here and in the tower SPEC, `opaque` marks a public abstraction boundary, not a
requirement that the implementation literally use an `opaque` Lean declaration.
Implementations use representation-private structures where constructors or
recursors are needed internally.

Every `AlgebraicNumber` smart constructor normalizes the primitive polynomial.
The normalized polynomial `X` uses one fixed explicit certified representative;
this makes canonical zero total without depending on success of the bounded
isolation driver. Every other polynomial is re-isolated with the fixed default
strategy at `separationDepth`, storing the unique matching disc. Thus equal
complex values have identical hidden data, not merely a semantic `BEq`; this
representation can support field laws stated with Lean equality. User-supplied
alternative refined discs cannot enter the private constructor. The sealed
record retains provenance that its representative belongs to the deterministic
isolation/refinement array (or is the fixed `X` representative); the companion
uses pairwise root separation in that array to prove this invariant unique.
The certificate stored inside `RefinedIsolation` is proof-relevant, so this
canonical-provenance field is load-bearing: every constructor path must use the
fixed `zeroRep` or `canonicalRep?`, never insert an independently transported
certificate directly.

Do not instantiate `DensePoly AlgebraicNumber` in the Mathlib-free layer.
`DensePoly` requires a kernel `DecidableEq` on coefficients so trailing-zero
normalization is semantic, while canonical algebraic-number equality is exposed
here as a Boolean operation whose correctness is proved only in the companion.
Structural equality on factorization-lazy `AlgebraicRoot` is finer than equality
of represented complex values. `AlgebraicPoly` owns the required semantic
trimming without exporting an unjustified `DecidableEq`. That Boolean
operation is `AlgebraicPoly.beq` (with its `BEq` instance): coefficientwise
canonical equality over the trimmed data. Its faithfulness on canonical
coefficients follows from the companion's `LawfulBEq AlgebraicNumber`
plus trimming; packaging that as an `AlgebraicPoly.beq_iff` is Phase-6
work (#9418). `coeff n` is the canonical
coefficient (`0` beyond the degree) and `size` is the trimmed length backing
`degree?`; all three are exercised by the module's compiled regressions.

## Equality and zero

`AlgebraicNumber` keeps its canonical `BEq`: compare minimal polynomials, then
compare refined isolations with `sameRoot`.

`AlgebraicRoot` uses two paths:

1. If the stored polynomials agree, compare the refined isolations directly.
2. Otherwise exactify both roots and use canonical `AlgebraicNumber` equality.

The second path can factor twice and is not a fast arithmetic primitive. A future
optimization may compare `gcd a.p b.p` and the two isolations without computing
minimal polynomials, but it does not change the v1 semantics.

```lean
def AlgebraicNumber.isZero (a : AlgebraicNumber) : Bool := a.p == X

/-- True exactly when the selected root is zero. The refined separation bound
    makes the constant-coefficient and closed-disc test decisive. -/
def AlgebraicRoot.isZero (a : AlgebraicRoot) : Bool :=
  a.p.coeff 0 == 0 && RefinedIsolation.containsZero a.rep
```

`RefinedIsolation.containsZero` is introduced here. It tests membership of zero
in the isolation's closed circumscribed disc, including boundary contact, by
delegating to the generic exact `DyadicSquare.discContains` geometry primitive.

## Fixed-field operations

`QAdjoin p x` retains canonical reduced rational coordinates. Addition,
subtraction, negation, multiplication modulo `p`, and rational scalar actions do
not require irreducibility. Inversion requires
`[ZPoly.CheckedIrreducible p]` and uses polynomial extended gcd over `ℚ`.
The computational API supplies `Inv` and `Div`, with `0⁻¹ = 0`; the companion
proves their field laws after converting the checked certificate to semantic
irreducibility.

```lean
def QAdjoin.approx (a : QAdjoin p x) (rep : RefinedIsolation p)
    (h : SimpleRoot.mk rep = x) (prec : Int) :
    RefinedIsolation p × DyadicComplexBall

theorem QAdjoin.approx_root (a : QAdjoin p x)
    (rep : RefinedIsolation p) (h : SimpleRoot.mk rep = x) (prec : Int) :
    SimpleRoot.mk (a.approx rep h prec).1 = x
```

Approximation refines once, returns the refined representative for threading,
and always returns a sound ball. The requested radius is guaranteed by the
companion's mixed-strategy refinement-completeness theorem. That proof uses
the selected atom's local simplicity and permits repeated roots elsewhere in
its ambient polynomial; it does not rely on a global squarefreeness premise.

For `n := a.coeffs.size`, evaluation uses target precision

```text
prec + 8 + ceilLog2(n + 1) + coeffBits(a.coeffs)
  + n * (rootBits(rep.square) + 3).
```

`coeffBits` bounds rational coefficient magnitudes by numerator bit length;
`rootBits` bounds the selected root using the current square's centre and
circumscribed-disc radius. The per-Horner-step `+3` covers both movement within
the certified refinement region and the dyadic `hi`/circumscribed-disc
overestimates. It is part of the soundness budget, not optional slack.

## Canonicalization and exactification

```lean
def AlgebraicNumber.toQAdjoin (a : AlgebraicNumber) : QAdjoin a.p a.x
def AlgebraicNumber.toRoot (a : AlgebraicNumber) : AlgebraicRoot

def QAdjoin.toAlgebraicNumber? [ZPoly.CheckedIrreducible p]
    (a : QAdjoin p x) (rep : RefinedIsolation p)
    (h : SimpleRoot.mk rep = x) : Option AlgebraicNumber
def QAdjoin.toAlgebraicNumber [ZPoly.CheckedIrreducible p]
    (a : QAdjoin p x) (rep : RefinedIsolation p)
    (h : SimpleRoot.mk rep = x) : AlgebraicNumber

/-- Checked implementation layer. -/
def AlgebraicRoot.exact? (a : AlgebraicRoot) : Option AlgebraicNumber
/-- Primary total API. -/
def AlgebraicRoot.exact (a : AlgebraicRoot) : AlgebraicNumber :=
  a.exact?.getD (panicWith 0 "AlgebraicRoot.exact: certification failed")
```

`QAdjoin.toAlgebraicNumber?` materializes `1, a, a², ...` once with one
fixed-field multiplication per new power, finds the first Krylov dependence by
row reduction, clears denominators, normalizes the primitive part, and
identifies the matching isolated root.

`AlgebraicRoot.exact?` factors `a.p`, selects the unique irreducible factor whose
isolated root agrees with `a.rep`, and returns that factor in canonical form.
It reruns `ZPoly.isIrreducible` and the decidable `HasOnlySimpleRoots` check on
the normalized factor; successful branches carry the resulting equality and
squarefreeness proofs into the private `AlgebraicNumber` constructor.
`exact` is the primary interface. It uses `panicWith` only on the checked
implementation's `none` branch; `exact?_isSome` proves that branch unreachable.

## Factorization-lazy arithmetic

Each operation has a checked `Option` form and a primary total wrapper. The
checked form returns `none` only if a certificate fails to appear within its
input-computable bound. Companion `_isSome` theorems retire every such branch.

```lean
def AlgebraicRoot.add? (a b : AlgebraicRoot) : Option AlgebraicRoot
def AlgebraicRoot.add  (a b : AlgebraicRoot) : AlgebraicRoot
-- likewise sub, mul, div, and inv; neg is certificate-free

def AlgebraicNumber.add (a b : AlgebraicNumber) : AlgebraicNumber :=
  (a.toRoot.add b.toRoot).exact
-- likewise sub, mul, neg, inv, and div
```

- `neg` substitutes `-X` and reflects the isolation.
- `add?` takes the primitive positive-leading squarefree part of
  `resultant_y(a.p(y), b.p(t-y))`.
- `sub?` composes addition and negation.
- `mul?` handles zero first, then uses
  `resultant_y(a.p(y), y^deg(b.p) * b.p(t/y))`. It removes any
  introduced `X` factor before squarefree normalization.
- `inv? 0 = some 0`. Otherwise it reverses the coefficients of `a.p`, trims the
  degree drop caused by an original zero constant coefficient, takes the
  primitive positive-leading part, maps the isolation through inversion, and
  re-certifies it. The reversal has nonzero constant coefficient because it is
  the original leading coefficient, so it cannot acquire an `X` factor.
- `div?` composes multiplication and inversion.

The addition and multiplication eliminants are nonzero. Over an algebraic
closure their resultants are products of `t - (α + β)` or `t - αβ` over the
finite root multisets of the two nonzero input polynomials, so each has the
expected positive degree and nonzero leading coefficient. Stage 1 formalizes
the corresponding common-root statements; Stage 2 identifies the full product
when its value is needed.

For a binary eliminant `e`, the desired result may coincide with values from
other pairs of conjugates, but every candidate is a root of the same squarefree
polynomial. Define

```text
resultIsolationPrec(e) = separationDepth(e).
```

Refine the operation ball and candidate isolations to this precision. The
HexRoots separation theorem makes distinct candidates disjoint, so exactly one
candidate isolation meets the operation ball. This path does not need a second
eliminant or the Stage 2 resultant value theorem.

Candidate isolations use `resultIsolationPrec(e)` itself. The operand balls use
an additional, input-computable guard: four bits for addition,
`8 + rootBits(a) + rootBits(b)` for multiplication, and
`2 * ceilLog2(1 + coeffAbsMax(a.p)) + 16` for inversion. The multiplication
guard pays for operand-magnitude amplification. The reciprocal guard combines
the reciprocal Cauchy lower bound with the quadratic distortion of inversion
and dyadic rounding. The selected operation ball is two bits smaller than the
candidate separation precision for addition and four bits smaller for
multiplication and inversion.

Canonical `AlgebraicNumber` arithmetic converts inputs with `toRoot`, performs
the lazy operation, then calls `exact`. A many-input common-field routine is used
internally only for polynomials with canonical algebraic coefficients.
Canonical `AlgebraicNumber` exposes the ordinary arithmetic operations, with
`inv 0 = 0`; the Mathlib companion installs and proves the law-bearing field
structure. `AlgebraicRoot` exposes named operations but no field structure:
two semantically equal lazy results can have different enclosing polynomials,
so the field laws do not hold for structural equality on that record.

The executable rational and power surface is:

```lean
def AlgebraicNumber.ofRat (q : Rat) : AlgebraicNumber
instance : One AlgebraicNumber
instance : NatCast AlgebraicNumber
instance : IntCast AlgebraicNumber
instance (n : Nat) : OfNat AlgebraicNumber (n + 2)
instance : SMul Rat AlgebraicNumber
instance : SMul Nat AlgebraicNumber
instance : SMul Int AlgebraicNumber
instance : Pow AlgebraicNumber Nat
instance : Pow AlgebraicNumber Int
```

`ofRat` is the total wrapper around the checked linear-polynomial constructor;
its panic fallback is proved unreachable by the companion. Rational scalar
multiplication is multiplication by `ofRat q`, and powers use the existing
executable multiplication and inversion with repeated squaring.

## Polynomial roots

```lean
def QAdjoin.roots? [ZPoly.CheckedIrreducible p]
    (f : DensePoly (QAdjoin p x))
    (rep : RefinedIsolation p) (h : SimpleRoot.mk rep = x) :
    Option RootSet
def QAdjoin.roots [ZPoly.CheckedIrreducible p] (...) : RootSet

def AlgebraicPoly.roots? (f : AlgebraicPoly) : Option RootSet
def AlgebraicPoly.roots  (f : AlgebraicPoly) : RootSet
```

The zero polynomial returns `some .all`; `none` is reserved for certification
failure. Finite output is normalized, duplicate-free, sorted by polynomial then
isolation coordinates, and carries positive multiplicities.

For `QAdjoin.roots?`:

1. Run Yun decomposition over the coefficient field. Process each squarefree
   component separately; a root from the component indexed by `e` receives
   multiplicity `e`.
2. Clear coefficient denominators and form the norm eliminant over `ℚ` by a
   resultant with `p`. It is nonzero because coefficients are reduced modulo the
   irreducible `p`.
3. Normalize and isolate the eliminant's roots.
4. Reject candidates belonging only to other embeddings of `QAdjoin p x` by
   evaluating the original component at the candidate and the selected `x`.
   Refute wrong candidates at `evalDisambiguationPrec`.
5. Return the surviving `AlgebraicRoot` values with the Yun multiplicity.

`AlgebraicPoly.roots?` first embeds all nonzero coefficients into one computed
primitive `QAdjoin`, then invokes the fixed-field algorithm. This common-field
construction is deterministic and bounded, is not used for binary arithmetic,
and is a public surface in its own right (the tower library builds on it); its
contract is the next section.

For a candidate evaluation, construct its integer eliminant `q`, remove its
maximal `X` power, and take the primitive part. If the evaluation is nonzero,
`q(0) ≠ 0` and the reciprocal Cauchy bound gives
`|value| ≥ 1 / (1 + height(q))`. Let `C` be the explicit Horner error majorant
computed from the input coefficient heights, degrees, and Cauchy root bounds.
Define `evalDisambiguationPrec` as the least precision in the finite range

```text
0 .. ceilLog2(ceil(2 * (1 + height(q)) * C)) + 2
```

whose Horner enclosure radius is below `1 / (3 * (1 + height(q)))`.
The factor `3` accounts for the shipped zero-exclusion test using the maximum
absolute centre coordinate, which may be a factor `sqrt 2` below the Euclidean
centre norm. The displayed search endpoint still has sufficient slack.
The displayed endpoint proves that the bounded search succeeds. The same
construction, with the eliminant for each generator/factor evaluation, is used
by tower adjoining. No API performs unbounded refinement.

## Common-field construction

The `Hex.AlgebraicPoly.Common` namespace is the public bounded
primitive-element machinery behind `AlgebraicPoly.roots?`, consumed directly
by hex-number-field-tower (raw evaluation, flattening recovery) and its
Mathlib companion. Everything is option-valued and checked: a `none` records
a failed certification, never a wrong value.

```lean
structure Presentation where
  generator : AlgebraicNumber
  coefficients : Array (QAdjoin generator.p generator.x)

def signedShift : Nat → Int
def rational? (q : Rat) : Option AlgebraicNumber
def add? (a b : AlgebraicNumber) : Option AlgebraicNumber
def mul? (a b : AlgebraicNumber) : Option AlgebraicNumber
def scale? (c : Int) (a : AlgebraicNumber) : Option AlgebraicNumber
def shift? (theta alpha : AlgebraicNumber) (c : Int) : Option AlgebraicNumber
def degree (a : AlgebraicNumber) : Nat

structure ShiftCandidate where
  shift : Int
  value : AlgebraicNumber

def extendShiftStep (theta alpha : AlgebraicNumber) :
    Option ShiftCandidate → Nat → Option (Option ShiftCandidate)
def extendShift? (theta alpha : AlgebraicNumber) : Option ShiftCandidate
def extend? (theta alpha : AlgebraicNumber) : Option AlgebraicNumber
def primitive? (coefficients : Array AlgebraicNumber) : Option AlgebraicNumber
def powers? (gamma : AlgebraicNumber) (last : Nat) :
    Option (Array AlgebraicNumber)
def trace? (ambient : Nat) (a : AlgebraicNumber) : Option Rat
def coordinates? (gamma a : AlgebraicNumber)
    (powers : Array AlgebraicNumber) : Option (QAdjoin gamma.p gamma.x)
def presentation? (coefficients : Array AlgebraicNumber) :
    Option Presentation
```

`signedShift` is the deterministic shift order `0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...`.
`rational?`, `add?`, `mul?`, `scale?`, and `shift?` are the checked canonical
constructions the search composes: `shift? theta alpha c` is the
primitive-element candidate `theta + c * alpha`, with `c = 0` returning
`theta` unchanged.

`extend? theta alpha` is the bounded primitive-element search: it tests
`choose(degree theta * degree alpha, 2) + 1` signed shifts and keeps a
maximum-degree candidate, which generates the compositum even when the two
fields overlap. `extendShift?` is the same search retaining the producing
shift (the form the tower's flattening recovery needs), and
`extendShiftStep` is its single fold step, exposed so consumers can interleave
the search with their own early exits. `primitive?` folds `extend?` over the
nonzero entries of a coefficient array.

`powers? gamma last` returns the checked canonical powers
`1, gamma, ..., gamma^last`. `trace? ambient a` is the field trace of `a`
from a known ambient degree: with `m = degree a` it requires `m ∣ ambient`
and returns `(ambient / m)` times the conjugate sum
`-coeff (m-1) / leadingCoeff`. `coordinates? gamma a powers` recovers the
power-basis coordinate of `a` through the nondegenerate trace pairing (Gram
matrix of power traces against the traces of `a * gamma^k`), then validates
the recovered coordinate by canonical algebraic equality before returning it.
`presentation?` composes the above: find a primitive generator, take its
powers up to `2 * degree - 2`, embed every coefficient, and return the
validated fixed-field `Presentation`.

## Totalization

`panicWith fallback message` prints in compiled code and is definitionally the
fallback for proofs. Total algebraic operations use it only around checked forms
whose `_isSome` theorem is part of the companion contract. `exact`, arithmetic,
and both `roots` functions are the primary user APIs; the `?` forms remain public
for diagnostics and staged proofs.

`AlgebraicNumber` has canonical zero `p = X`, so it supplies the `Inhabited`
fallback used by exactification. `RootSet.all` is the loud fallback for the two
total root wrappers; their `_isSome` theorems make it unreachable.

Conformance and benchmark drivers live in the shared `conformance/` and
`bench/` sub-projects.

## Conformance

- *core*: at least three cases per public operation, including `√2 + √2`,
  `√2 * √2`, `√2 + (-√2)`, inversion of zero, equal values represented by
  different nonminimal polynomials, an enclosing polynomial with irrelevant
  factors, repeated input roots, and a conjugate-embedding impostor.
- *ci*: deterministic small-degree fixtures checked by cypari2. Use
  python-flint independently for integer resultants, factorization, and certified
  complex-root balls.
- *local*: degree-product stress cases and optional Nemo/Hecke comparisons.

Sage is not an oracle. Root comparisons use multiplicity buckets and compare the
oracle's independently computed decomposition with Lean's finite output.

## Complexity and Phase 4 budgets

- Fixed-field arithmetic has the existing dense-polynomial costs; a compiled
  degree-10 field operation remains capped at 100 ms on the reference host.
- A lazy binary operation has eliminant degree at most
  `deg(a.p) * deg(b.p)`. Its ceiling is the measured resultant cost plus the
  existing HexRoots ceiling at that eliminant degree. Do not promise a faster
  end-to-end time than root isolation itself.
- Degree-product at most 20 is the largest merge-facing lazy arithmetic class.
  Larger cases are local until new measurements justify promotion.
- Exactification adds one Berlekamp-Zassenhaus factorization and factor-root
  selection. Root APIs add Yun decomposition and one norm eliminant per
  squarefree component.

Phase 4 records separate timings for eliminant construction, isolation,
disambiguation, and exactification so regressions are attributable.
