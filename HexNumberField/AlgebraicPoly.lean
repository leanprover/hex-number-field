Polynomials with canonical algebraic coefficients.

This representation owns semantic trailing-zero normalization. In particular,
the Mathlib-free layer never instantiates `DensePoly AlgebraicNumber`: its
normalizer would require a kernel {name}`DecidableEq`, while canonical algebraic
equality is intentionally exposed here only through checked Boolean equality.
