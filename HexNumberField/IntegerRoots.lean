Roots of integer polynomials as canonical algebraic numbers, the reality
test on stored isolations, and display.

`ZPoly.algebraicRoots` is the entry point a user reaches for first: it turns
an integer polynomial into its distinct complex roots, each a canonical
`AlgebraicNumber`, real roots first in increasing order. The reality test
compares the centre of a stored isolation with the dyadic upper bound of its
disc radius; at separation precision that decides reality exactly, as the
companion proves.

increasing order of their isolation centres, which is their order as real
numbers; then the nonreal roots ordered lexicographically by isolation
centre, real part first, then imaginary part, then precision. That order is
deterministic, but it depends on the isolations rather than on the roots
alone, so no client should rely on more than its determinism. -/

Irreducible, like `algebraicRoots`, so that a type such as `PolyQuot a.p a.x`

value while looking for a printing instance, and must not run the root
isolation symbolically. Proofs unfold it explicitly. -/

not returned; use `AlgebraicPoly.roots` for them. A constant polynomial,
including zero, has no roots here. Irreducible for the reason given at

its reduced coordinates ascribed to the presentation they live in, with the

The representative comes out of the `Quot` by `unquot`, as Mathlib's `Multiset`
and `Finset` instances do, so the instance is `unsafe` and the printed square is
whichever representative the value happens to carry. That choice is invisible in
the result: `Intersects` compares stored squares, so every representative of the
root rebuilds the same element. -/
