Core representations for exact algebraic numbers.

`QAdjoin` stores reduced rational coordinates in a fixed presentation,
`AlgebraicRoot` stores a squarefree factorization-lazy root, and
`AlgebraicNumber` seals the canonical irreducible representation behind a
private constructor. The only constructor exposed to later implementation
modules uses the fixed representative of zero for `X`; all other inputs run
the fixed root isolator and select its canonical disc.

retired only by the Mathlib companion's completeness proof. -/
